# Lab 1, Part 1 — More Underscore

## Introduction

Set variables "query1" through "query7" by using underscore functions to answer
the specified question.

There are two stretch goals. In the final one,  you will be asked to use a templating
system. You are encouraged to at least try and use underscore's templating function
as it will give you some idea about how an important and common problem in computing
(i.e. how can I create text given a collection of data?)

var bakedGoods = [
  {
    "name": "Carrot",
    "type": "Cake",
    "inventory": 44,
    "price": 3.49
  },
  {
    "name": "Chocolate",
    "type": "Cake",
    "inventory": 21,
    "price": 3.49
  },
  {
    "name": "Sourdough",
    "type": "Bread",
    "inventory": 5,
    "price": 5.29
  },
  {
    "name": "Tiramisu",
    "type": "Cake",

    "price": 4.99
  },
  {
    "name": "Rye",
    "type": "Bread",
    "inventory": 6,
    "price": 5.09

var printMenu = function(foodList) {
  _.each(foodList, function(food) {
    console.log(food.name + ' ... $' + food.price);
  });
};

console.log('List of baked goods', bakedGoods);

/* =====================
Is printMenu a function? Answer this question with underscore. Should evaluate
to true.
===================== */

var query1 = _.isFunction(printMenu);

console.log('printMenu is a function:', query1);

/* =====================
Is bakedGoods an array? Answer this question with underscore. Should evaluate
to true.
===================== */

var query2 = _.isArray(bakedGoods[0]);

console.log('bakedGoods is an array:', query2);

/* =====================
Is the first element in bakedGoods an object? Answer this question with
underscore. Should evaluate to true.
===================== */

var query3 = _.isObject(bakedGoods[0]);

console.log('The first element in bakedGoods is an object:', query3);

/* =====================
Use _.where to return all cakes. Or bread. Whichever is your favorite.
===================== */

var query4 = _.where(bakedGoods, {"type": "Bread"});

console.log('All bread. Or cakes:', query4);

/* =====================
Use _.filter to return all baked goods that cost more than $4.
===================== */

var query5 = _.filter(bakedGoods, function(bakedGoods){return bakedGoods.price > 4});

console.log('More than $4:', query5);

/* =====================
Use _.sortBy to order the list by inventory (from lowest to highest).
===================== */

var query6 = _.sortBy(bakedGoods, function(bakedGoods){return bakedGoods.inventory});

console.log('Sorted by inventory (lowest to highest):', query6);

/* =====================
Use _.groupBy to organize the baked goods by type.
===================== */

var query7 = _.groupBy(bakedGoods, 'type');

console.log('Grouped by type:', query7);

/* =====================
Grouping by type (query7) changed the structure/shape of our data. Instead of an
array of objects (e.g. [{}, {}]), we have an object that contains arrays of objects
(e.g. {'key1': [{}, {}], 'key2': [{}, {}]}). Let's do something with this structure.

Write a printMenuGroups function to receive the new structure (query7) and print
(console.log) a menu with headings. Running printMenuGroups(query7) should log:

Cake
Carrot ... $3.49
Chocolate ... $3.49
Tiramisu ... $4.99
Bread
Sourdough ... $5.29
Rye ... $5.09
Whole Wheat ... $4.49

===================== */

/* =====================
We're probably writing each line of the menu with the code `food.name + " ... $" + food.price`.
While this method technically works, it will become less manageable when the
content becomes more complicated (this can happen as the number of strings and variables
increases). Underscore has a 'templating' system that can be used to clean up this
rendering process.

Use _.template or javascript built-in templating (javascript template strings - google it)
to render the price lines of the menu (Carrot ... $3.49). Templates are powerful and allow
you to write much clearer code with text substitution. Consider all the places and ways
strings come up - templates make the introduction of variability simpler.
